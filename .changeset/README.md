# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repo](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Adding a changeset

When you make changes to a package, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the semver bump type (major/minor/patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

The changeset file will be committed with your PR.

## Releasing

When PRs with changesets are merged to `main`, a "Version Packages" PR will be automatically created.
Merging that PR will publish the packages to npm.
