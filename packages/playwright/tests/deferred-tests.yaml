# Spekra SDK - Deferred Test Cases
# =================================
# This file tracks test cases that have been identified but are deferred
# for later implementation. Use this to capture issues and edge cases
# discovered during development without writing tests immediately.
#
# Why defer tests?
#   - Code is still in flux and may change significantly
#   - Want to batch test writing for efficiency
#   - Need to capture the issue before forgetting it
#   - Waiting for related features to stabilize
#
# When to promote a test:
#   - Feature/fix is stable and unlikely to change
#   - Ready to write the actual test implementation
#   - Write the test in the appropriate test file
#   - DELETE the entry from this file (don't keep promoted tests here)
#
# Status values:
#   - pending: Not yet implemented
#   - cancelled: No longer needed (keep with reason briefly, then delete)
#
# Entry format:
#   - id: unique-kebab-case-id
#     name: Short descriptive name
#     description: |
#       Detailed description of what needs to be tested and why.
#     priority: P1 | P2 | P3
#     discovered: YYYY-MM-DD
#     context: |
#       Additional context about the issue or how it was discovered.
#     test_scenarios:
#       - given: Initial state
#         when: Action taken
#         then: Expected result
